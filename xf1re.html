            <b>ByWindow</b> simply checks for an open window. <b>ByProcessWindow</b> checks for any open process, even if it is in the background. The <b>Substr</b> variants stand for "substrate", and refer to any running program that is split into multiple processes. (Firefox and Chromium browsers are an example of this; check the Details tab under Task Manager and you'll see them listed several times.)
        </p>
        <!-- Ask: can you just unilaterally use ByProcessWindowSubstr for any game without adverse side effects? -->
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Based on which detect type you choose, Xf1re will look for any window based on the criteria given with the <b>ProcessWindowTitle</b> and/or <b>ProcessWindowClass</b> properties. <b>ProcessWindowTitle</b> simply checks the title of the window: if the given substring is found in the title of any open window, Xfire will recognize it as the game in question. <b>ProcessWindowClass</b> goes a step deeper and checks for the window's class instead, which can be preferred for games that have a changing or inconsistent window title, or to avoid false positives. <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/winlister.html" target="_blank">NirSoft's WinLister</a> can be used to find the class of any open window.

            As an example of these properties in action, take the game Persona 5 Royal.

            Under normal circumstances, Xf1re will not be able to detect the game running. However, by adding the following code to its game entry with the help of WinLister:
        </p>

        <p class="code">
            PlayingDetectType=ByWindow<br>
            ProcessWindowTitle=Persona 5 Royal<br>
            ProcessWindowClass=P5R
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Xf1re is now able to detect the game running. Notice how the status next to my name near the top of the Xf1re window reads "Persona 5 Royal". (Ignore its absence in my friends list, that's just because the game hasn't been submitted to Xf1re yet.)
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold;">
            Bear in mind, this solution isn't guaranteed to work. For currently unknown reasons, some games won't be detected by Xf1re even with these properties in place.
